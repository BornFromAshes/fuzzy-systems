# fuzzy-systems

In this project, our goal is to design a fuzzy expert system for diagnosing heart disease. <br>
The inputs to this problem include the following:
- Chest pain: This entry specifies the degree of chest pain. This input is a crisp input and has only four values, one, two, three, or four. If its value is one, it indicates typical angina, if its value is two, it indicates atypical angina, if its value is three, it indicates non-anginal pain. If its value is four, it means asymptomatic.
- Blood pressure: This entry specifies the blood pressure of the person.
- Cholesterol: This entry specifies the level of cholesterol of the person.
- Blood sugar: This input specifies the blood sugar level of the person.
- ECG is a non-invasive test that can detect abnormalities such as arrhythmias, evidence of coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy and bundle branch blocks.
- Maximum heart rate: This input shows the maximum heart rate of a person during 24 hours.
- Sports activity: This input is a crisp input and has only two values zero or one. If it is zero, it means that sports activity is not suitable for the person, and if it is one, it means that there is no obstacle for the person.
- Peak Old: This entry specifies the level of depression of the person.
- Thallium amount: This entry specifies the amount of thallium (a chemical element) in a person's body. This entry is also a crisp entry and only takes three values: 3, 6, and 7. If the thallium amount is 3, it is normal, if it is 6, it is average, and if it is 7 is high.
- Gender: This input is also a crisp input and has only two values zero and one. If it is zero, it means that the patient is male, and if it is one, it means that the patient is female.
- Age: This entry specifies the age of the person.
<br> 
Finally, the output determines whether or not a person is suffering from heart disease, which is explained in more detail below.
